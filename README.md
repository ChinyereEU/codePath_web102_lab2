samosa-selector


This web app game allows the user to gain as many samosas as possible per click. 
The user can also purchase different samosa packages depending on how many samosas they currently have. The transaction is acknowledged by reducing the user's samosa count by the amount of samosas it cost the user to purchase the upgrade.
The change in number of samosas the user has is reflected on the screen.
